#Before starting the testing server you will need to install a few libraries in your virtualenv, mine is call venv, so:
(venv) pip install -r requirements.py

#Start server
FLASK_APP=server.py flask run

#You will now be able to access the testing server on localhost:5000/

* server.py
contains the the flask server

* templates/index.html
is a simple web page that can make a call to local server,
which in turn call the private on unforgettable.me and returns a response


Between this code and your xterm code you should be able to keep working on the console. Let me know if you need help setting things up.



Potential gotcha.
=================
When Simon tried to pip install -r requirements his mac complained that he didn't have the openssl libs install on his computer. Presumably openssl shouldn't be too hard to install with a bit of Googling.
