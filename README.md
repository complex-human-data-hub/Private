# Private
Parser for private

regex for string_literal was taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/171480/regex-grabbing-values-between-quotation-marks

Currently not so sure about how to parse across multiple lines. If the parsing is done line by line using readline() then the define_function rule will fail.
